Description:
HappyDB is a corpus of more than 100,000 happy moments crowd-sourced via
Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk.
Each worker is given the following task:
What made you happy today? Reflect on the past 24 hours, and recall
three actual events that happened to you that made you happy. Write
down your happy moment in a complete sentence.
(Write three such moments.)

The goal of the corpus is to advance the understanding of the
causes of happiness through text-based reflection.

More information is available on the HappyDB website (https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/).

Dataset:
- cleaned_hm.csv: the cleaned-up corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments.
For cleaning up, we have done spell checking over the whole corpus, and remove empty
or one-word statements.
The raw happy moments are retained for reference, and the author of each happy
moment is represented by the his/her worker ID.

- demographic.csv: the demographic information of the worker who provided the
moment. 
The information includes worker id, age, country, gender, marital status, and
status of parenthood.

Have fun with the data!

To provide some inspiration, here are a few interesting exploration questions I can think of.

- What are the popular sports/movies/books/purchased products/tourist
destinations/... that make people happy?
- Can we predict gender/marriage status/parenthood/age groups based on happy moment texts?
- How many indoor and outdoor activities are in the corpus respectively?
- Can we find interesting ways of clustering happy moments?
