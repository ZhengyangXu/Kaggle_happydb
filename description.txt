Description:
HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments.
The goal of the corpus is to advance the state of the art of understanding the
causes of happiness that can be gleaned from text.

Dataset:
- cleaned_hm.csv: the cleaned-up corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments.
For example, we have done spell checking over the whole corpus, and remove empty
or one-word statements.

- demographic.csv: the demographic information of the worker who provided the
moment.
The information includes worker id, age, country, gender, marital status, and
status of parenthood.


The happy moments are crowd-sourced via Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk. Each worker is
given the following task:
What made you happy today? Reflect on the past 24 hours, and recall
three actual events that happened to you that made you happy. Write
down your happy moment in a complete sentence.
(Write three such moments.)


Here are a few interesting candidate tasks worth exploring.
Of course, explore the corpus in whatever way you want:)

Entity Extraction tasks:
- Find the purchased products that make people happy.
- Find the tourist destinations that make people happy.
- Find the sports that people enjoy most.
